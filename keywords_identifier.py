#In Python, keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and are used to define the syntax and structure of the language. Identifiers, on the other hand, are user-defined names given to variables, functions, classes, and other objects. Identifiers must follow certain rules and conventions, while keywords cannot be used as identifiers. Here are a few examples of both keywords and identifiers:

#Python Keywords:
#Keywords cannot be used as identifier

# Examples of Python keywords
if
else
while
for
def
class
return
try
except
import




#Python Identifiers:
#Identifiers are user-defined names that follow certain rules and conventions.

# Examples of valid identifiers
variable_name
counter
my_function
ClassA
my_list
PI

# Examples of invalid identifiers (because they are keywords)
if
else
for
while
def
class
return
Here are a few more rules for valid identifiers:

#Cannot start with a number
#Can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores
#Cannot be a Python keyword
#Should follow a meaningful naming convention for readability (e.g., total_amount instead of ta)
